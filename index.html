      <p>Horus University aims to graduate well-rounded students who will be beneficial to society at first. But the main motto in Horus is self-sufficiency, 
        it may fit into both our students and school. It goes in the same direction with education policy and students, graduate students and gain teachers, that is the policy. 
        In space, conditions are extreme and self sufficiency starts psychologically. Then, if we look at the bigger picture, Horus University is also a self-sufficient institution. 
        Goal is to maintain the research and this is provided with Horus-1's own energy, money, and knowledge. The loop continues inside, the key point is to manage it, we believe our 
        students in that point. They will be having normal lessons and courses based on the fundamental science branches in an optional way as the other universities; however, there is 
        a reason that Horus University is the most functionable university instead of the most demanded university. Of course, Horus’s possibilities are high standards but every student 
        should sacrifice something to be a part of it and the mentality makes us stand out. Every student had exams to be accepted to Horus and their aim is passing through this school, 
        this is why they are the students of Horus university. In brief, advanced research requires advanced students, our mission is to educate advanced students who already have the 
        perseverance to achieve it.

      <h2 class="text-center"></span>Research</h2>
      <h3><span id="undergraduates"></span>Undergraduates solve the mystery of the bright areas on Ceres</h3>
      <p>Our astrophysics and geology majors collaborated in order to prepare an extended research paper concerning the bright spots we see on the surface of Ceres. 
        With the help of their professors, our crew went on an expedition to the Occator crater. Hawking-1 probe, named after the honorable theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, 
        was used to transport the crew to the surface of Ceres. Students brought their special testing equipment to collect specimen dust that was later thoroughly analyzed in our 
        chemistry labs. The composition of the dust indicates that bright locations were deposits mostly made of sodium carbonate. They are likely the leftovers of a liquid that 
        made its way to the surface and immediately evaporated, leaving behind a shiny salt crust. By analyzing the data collected, students hypothesized that the liquid probably 
        came from a deep reservoir of salt-enriched water. Using specialized radars, we were able to locate a water mass that is about 40 kilometers deep and hundreds of kilometers 
        wide. The students that took part in the project received a certificate of achievement and a money prize of 500 dollars. If you want to do a similar project, you can ask 
        your related professor or apply to the department of researches.</p>
      
      <h3><span id="psychology"></span>Psychology students won a competition!</h3>
      <p>Today, a team conducted by three psychology students,  Melisa Topaloğlu, Judith Mellum, and Nuru Igwe, won a research competition at Earth. Their research was 
        about the effects of a change in the environment that is space for mentally ill people as we had a lot of neurodivergent people on campus. They first did interviews 
        with them and got through the results. They found out that despite the common misconception that neurodivergent people don’t want to get out of their comfort zone, 
        space actually helps them get away from the problems they face on earth. They additionally looked at the neurological effects of this thesis and found the same result. 
        They worked so hard and this research took four months but it was worth it. They claimed their prize digitally this morning. </p>
