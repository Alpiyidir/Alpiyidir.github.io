      <p>Horus University aims to graduate well-rounded students who will be beneficial to society at first. But the
        main motto in Horus is self-sufficiency,
        it may fit into both our students and school. It goes in the same direction with education policy and students,
        graduate students and gain teachers, that is the policy.
        In space, conditions are extreme and self sufficiency starts psychologically. Then, if we look at the bigger
        picture, Horus University is also a self-sufficient institution.
        Goal is to maintain the research and this is provided with Horus-1's own energy, money, and knowledge. The loop
        continues inside, the key point is to manage it, we believe our
        students in that point. They will be having normal lessons and courses based on the fundamental science branches
        in an optional way as the other universities; however, there is
        a reason that Horus University is the most functionable university instead of the most demanded university. Of
        course, Horus’s possibilities are high standards but every student
        should sacrifice something to be a part of it and the mentality makes us stand out. Every student had exams to
        be accepted to Horus and their aim is passing through this school,
        this is why they are the students of Horus university. In brief, advanced research requires advanced students,
        our mission is to educate advanced students who already have the
        perseverance to achieve it.
        Just like our name, Horus, that comes from the god of vision, our vision and our future is the most important thing 
        here in Horus University. By carrying the expectations from a regular university to the next level, Horus achieves to 
        take the concept of learning a step further. Here, students can continue their studies by using the resources from space 
        while professors can improve their research by using the resources in space to help humanity. By caring about the future 
        of humanity as a whole, Horus University aims to fulfill what Horus, the god of vision suggests, creating a brighter future.

      <p>Our astrophysics and geology majors collaborated in order to prepare an extended research paper concerning the
        bright spots we see on the surface of Ceres.
        With the help of their professors, our crew went on an expedition to the Occator crater. Hawking-1 probe, named
        after the honorable theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking,
        was used to transport the crew to the surface of Ceres. Students brought their special testing equipment to
        collect specimen dust that was later thoroughly analyzed in our
        chemistry labs. The composition of the dust indicates that bright locations were deposits mostly made of sodium
        carbonate. They are likely the leftovers of a liquid that
        made its way to the surface and immediately evaporated, leaving behind a shiny salt crust. By analyzing the data
        collected, students hypothesized that the liquid probably
        came from a deep reservoir of salt-enriched water. Using specialized radars, we were able to locate a water mass
        that is about 40 kilometers deep and hundreds of kilometers
        wide. The students that took part in the project received a certificate of achievement and a money prize of 500
        dollars. If you want to do a similar project, you can ask
        your related professor or apply to the department of researches.</p>

      <p>Today, a team conducted by three psychology students, Melisa Topaloğlu, Judith Mellum, and Nuru Igwe, won a
        research competition at Earth. Their research was
        about the effects of a change in the environment that is space for mentally ill people as we had a lot of
        neurodivergent people on campus. They first did interviews
        with them and got through the results. They found out that despite the common misconception that neurodivergent
        people don’t want to get out of their comfort zone,
        space actually helps them get away from the problems they face on earth. They additionally looked at the
        neurological effects of this thesis and found the same result.
        They worked so hard and this research took four months but it was worth it. They claimed their prize digitally
        this morning. </p>

        <i style="font-weight:bold">In Horus-1</i><br>
        Whispers echoed in the hall. Curious eyes were looking around. The head principle in a white suit took the
        stand.<br>
        -The fate of humanity has changed with just a single step. It was a moist day in 1969, a light beam disappeared
        in the clouds between the gaze of 600 million. That beam was indeed three little musketeers, unaware of what
        they would face. After they passed the atmosphere, they left all the knowledge of mankind with it. That
        cheese-like dot was getting bigger and bigger then they took action for landing. Before they reached the ground,
        the debate was still ongoing, who will first step on the Moon? Finally, they gave this honour to the commander.
        He stood behind the door, with a feeling he has never seen before. Thrill and excitement were going all over his
        body, of course in zero-G, trying to escape from dismay. Doors were unlocked. Armstrong threw a glance at
        immense solitude, collapsed in silence, and said his iconic words “that’s one small step for man, one giant leap
        for mankind.” And he was right. It is fascinating to see how far humanity has come in not more than a century.
        That small dot guided us to beyond, to where we are right now. I can see many bright faces, ready to shine. I
        can see a bright future in them. Promising. You are the ones who will carry us further. We all have hopes and
        dreams. That’s why we’re all here. And today, we’re here to prove that we can do it. Together, we can do the
        imaginable. Everybody, welcome to Horus-1.
